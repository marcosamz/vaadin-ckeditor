We built the project using Eclipse 3.5 on Vaadin 6.3 nightly that also uses GWT 2.0.  These instructions assume you are doing the same.

We have not included the CKEditor 3.1 code.  Please download this directly from http://ckeditor.com/download.  Extract the code so that the directory 'ckeditor' is located in your src/org/vaadin/openesignforms/ckeditor/public folder.

You will then want to do a widgetset compile to generate the GWT-based code that will be put in WebContent/VAADIN/widgetsets.

The JAR file included has CKEditor and the widgetset all compiled and ready to use.  Just drop the JAR file in your Vaadin project's WebContent/WEB-INF/lib and you can use the example application in src/org/vaadin/openesignforms/VaadinCKEditorApplication.java for a quick tip on using it like a Vaadin textarea component.
